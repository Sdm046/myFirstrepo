      <p>While making the soccer ranking website, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and style a web page. I also learned how to make the page interactive with buttons and simple effects.
While working on the soccer part, I learned more about the best players in history and what makes them great. I compared their stats, trophies, and skills to decide how to rank them.</p>

      <p>so this project was about copying a website and i decided to reproduce my Mangas website where i read all the new chapters. It was the first time that i was creating a NAVbar, linking them with some section of my website and also the longest lines code that i have made for this summer intensive.
        I can assure that being able to understand every function of this project help me a lot even now to do my capstone project with all the knowledge that i have gained.   </p>

      <p>Formula1 has been i would say my second most favorite sports all time troughout the years. Learning about this sports and the history was so exciting for me that i was almost normal for me to showcase this passion with a HTML project. It was my first time doing html during the summer intensive and with the desire to do a great job i was able to assimilate many new funtions like the headers or body and div. </p>

       <p>From this project I actually learned how to code user input for javascript, now we have learned html and css I can put it all together now and see it work out. It was cool seeing how using the node console worked and how I could just type anything and It woul come out with a response but this was only possible by coding that</p>
